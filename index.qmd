## About Me
My name is Zheng Qianmu, and I come from an urban and rural planning background. I am currently a MUSA student. My email address is zheng21@upenn.edu, and my GitHub username is xqdqc_hub. I am taking this course to learn R, a highly powerful data analysis tool. Through friends in urban management studies, I have learned that quantitative analysis in public policy is a crucial component of both academic research and government work. I hope to gain relevant knowledge and have the opportunity to participate in a comprehensive policy analysis project.
