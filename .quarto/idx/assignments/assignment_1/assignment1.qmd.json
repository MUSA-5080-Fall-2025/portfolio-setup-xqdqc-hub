This concentration of uncertainty could lead algorithms to under-represent the needs of these areas.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n1/Overall Pattern Identification\nData reliability varies with dataset size. Larger counties have highly reliable estimates, and the MOE percentages at tract level are significantly higher than at county level, indicating that smaller datasets are more prone to producing unreliable results.\n\n2/Equity Assessment:\nCommunities with smaller populations and higher proportions of minority residents face the greatest risk of being misrepresented.\n\n3/Root Cause Analysis:\nData quality issues largely stem from limited survey sample sizes in sparsely populated or demographically diverse areas. Smaller sample sizes increase MOE, leading to higher uncertainty.\n\n4/Strategic Recommendations:\nThe Department should adjust algorithmic approaches to account for data reliability, such as weighting estimates by MOE or implementing safeguards for high-uncertainty communities through additional outreach, data validation, and supplemental surveys.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\nalgorithm_recommendations <- income_reliability %>%\n  select(\n    County = NAME,\n    Median_Income = median_incomeE,\n    MOE_Percentage = income_moe_pct,\n    Reliability = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Recommendation = case_when(\n      Reliability == \"High Confidence\"   ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      Reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      Reliability == \"Low Confidence\"    ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\nalgorithm_recommendations %>%\n  kable(\n    digits = 1,\n    caption = \"Algorithmic Decision Framework Based on County Data Reliability\"\n  )\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \nLos Angeles and Yuba. These counties have high confidence data with MOE percentages below 5%, and algorithms can safely use this data for resource allocation.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nIn this experiment, none were selected. My recommendations are that we should implement periodic review of algorithm outputs and consider using supplemental indicators or combining multiple data sources to reduce uncertainty.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \nSierra. I suggest avoiding relying solely on algorithmic outputs. We can collect additional survey data or use qualitative local knowledge to inform decisions.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n1/Are high MOE tracts clustered geographically?\n2/How do demographic changes over time affect the reliability of income and population estimates for small counties?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 2025.9.27\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-xqdqc-hub/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounties for tract-level analysis were selected to represent high, moderate, and low reliability areas. MOE percentages were calculated for income and demographic variables, and county/tract names were cleaned for consistency.\n\n**Limitations:**\nReliance on ACS data alone excludes other sources that could improve decision-making accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.

,? \"),\n    County = str_remove(County, \"Census Tract \\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?\"),\n    County = str_remove(County, \" County\"),\n    \n    Tract  = str_extract(NAME, \"Census Tract \\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?\")\n  )\n\n\n# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents\n# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract\ntop_hispanic_tract <- tract_data %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_hispanic)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(County, Tract, pct_hispanic)\n\n# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()\n# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group\ncounty_demographics <- tract_data %>%\n  group_by(County) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_tracts = n(),\n    avg_pct_white    = mean(pct_white, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_black    = mean(pct_black, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_hispanic = mean(pct_hispanic, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()\ncounty_demographics %>%\n  kable(\n    digits = 1,\n    caption = \"Average Tract-Level Demographics by Selected County\"\n  )\n```\n\n\n# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation\n\n## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables\n\n**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable\n- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%\n- Create summary statistics\n\n```{r demographic-moe}\n# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables\n# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)\ntract_data <- tract_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_white_moe   = (white_aloneM / white_aloneE) * 100,\n    pct_black_moe   = (black_aloneM / black_aloneE) * 100,\n    pct_hispanic_moe= (hispanicM / hispanicE) * 100,\n    \n    high_moe_flag = ifelse(\n      pct_white_moe > 15 | pct_black_moe > 15 | pct_hispanic_moe > 15,\n      TRUE,\n      FALSE\n    )\n  )\n\n# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable\nmoe_summary <- tract_data %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    tracts_high_moe = sum(high_moe_flag, na.rm = TRUE),\n    percent_high_moe = (tracts_high_moe / total_tracts) * 100\n  )\n\n# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues\nmoe_summary %>% kable(\n  digits = 1,\n  caption = \"Summary of Tracts with High MOE (>15%) for Demographic Variables\"\n)\n\n```\n\n## 4.2 Pattern Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.\n\n```{r pattern-analysis}\n# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues\n# Calculate average characteristics for each group:\n# - population size, demographic percentages\n# Use group_by() and summarize() to create this comparison\nmoe_pattern <- tract_data %>%\n  group_by(high_moe_flag) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_tracts = n(),\n    avg_total_population = mean(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_white        = mean(pct_white, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_black        = mean(pct_black, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_hispanic     = mean(pct_hispanic, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Create a professional table showing the patterns\nmoe_pattern %>%\n  kable(\n    digits = 1,\n    caption = \"Comparison of Tract Characteristics by Data Reliability (High MOE Flag)\"\n  )\n\n\n```\n\n**Pattern Analysis:** \nTracts with high MOE tend to have smaller populations and higher proportions of minority residents, suggesting that survey sample sizes are limited in these communities. This concentration of uncertainty could lead algorithms to under-represent the needs of these areas.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n1/Overall Pattern Identification\nData reliability varies with dataset size. Larger counties have highly reliable estimates, and the MOE percentages at tract level are significantly higher than at county level, indicating that smaller datasets are more prone to producing unreliable results.\n\n2/Equity Assessment:\nCommunities with smaller populations and higher proportions of minority residents face the greatest risk of being misrepresented.\n\n3/Root Cause Analysis:\nData quality issues largely stem from limited survey sample sizes in sparsely populated or demographically diverse areas. Smaller sample sizes increase MOE, leading to higher uncertainty.\n\n4/Strategic Recommendations:\nThe Department should adjust algorithmic approaches to account for data reliability, such as weighting estimates by MOE or implementing safeguards for high-uncertainty communities through additional outreach, data validation, and supplemental surveys.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\nalgorithm_recommendations <- income_reliability %>%\n  select(\n    County = NAME,\n    Median_Income = median_incomeE,\n    MOE_Percentage = income_moe_pct,\n    Reliability = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Recommendation = case_when(\n      Reliability == \"High Confidence\"   ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      Reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      Reliability == \"Low Confidence\"    ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\nalgorithm_recommendations %>%\n  kable(\n    digits = 1,\n    caption = \"Algorithmic Decision Framework Based on County Data Reliability\"\n  )\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \nLos Angeles and Yuba. These counties have high confidence data with MOE percentages below 5%, and algorithms can safely use this data for resource allocation.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nIn this experiment, none were selected. My recommendations are that we should implement periodic review of algorithm outputs and consider using supplemental indicators or combining multiple data sources to reduce uncertainty.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \nSierra. I suggest avoiding relying solely on algorithmic outputs. We can collect additional survey data or use qualitative local knowledge to inform decisions.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n1/Are high MOE tracts clustered geographically?\n2/How do demographic changes over time affect the reliability of income and population estimates for small counties?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 2025.9.27\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-xqdqc-hub/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounties for tract-level analysis were selected to represent high, moderate, and low reliability areas. MOE percentages were calculated for income and demographic variables, and county/tract names were cleaned for consistency.\n\n**Limitations:**\nReliance on ACS data alone excludes other sources that could improve decision-making accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
