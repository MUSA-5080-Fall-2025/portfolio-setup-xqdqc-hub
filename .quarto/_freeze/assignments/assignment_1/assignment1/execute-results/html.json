The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

Larger counties have highly reliable estimates, and the MOE percentages at tract level are significantly higher than at county level, indicating that smaller datasets are more prone to producing unreliable results.\n\n2/Equity Assessment:\nCommunities with smaller populations and higher proportions of minority residents face the greatest risk of being misrepresented.\n\n3/Root Cause Analysis:\nData quality issues largely stem from limited survey sample sizes in sparsely populated or demographically diverse areas. Smaller sample sizes increase MOE, leading to higher uncertainty.\n\n4/Strategic Recommendations:\nThe Department should adjust algorithmic approaches to account for data reliability, such as weighting estimates by MOE or implementing safeguards for high-uncertainty communities through additional outreach, data validation, and supplemental surveys.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

These counties have high confidence data with MOE percentages below 5%, and algorithms can safely use this data for resource allocation.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nIn this experiment, none were selected. My recommendations are that we should implement periodic review of algorithm outputs and consider using supplemental indicators or combining multiple data sources to reduce uncertainty.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \nSierra. I suggest avoiding relying solely on algorithmic outputs. We can collect additional survey data or use qualitative local knowledge to inform decisions.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n1/Are high MOE tracts clustered geographically?\n2/How do demographic changes over time affect the reliability of income and population estimates for small counties?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 2025.9.27\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-xqdqc-hub/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounties for tract-level analysis were selected to represent high, moderate, and low reliability areas. MOE percentages were calculated for income and demographic variables, and county/tract names were cleaned for consistency.\n\n**Limitations:**\nReliance on ACS data alone excludes other sources that could improve decision-making accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
