Through friends in urban management studies, I have learned that quantitative analysis in public policy is a crucial component of both academic research and government work. I hope to gain relevant knowledge and have the opportunity to participate in a comprehensive policy analysis project.\n\n\n\n\nEmail: zheng21@upenn.edu\nGitHub: @xqdqc_hub"
