I am currently a MUSA student. My email address is zheng21@upenn.edu, and my GitHub username is xqdqc_hub. I am taking this course to learn R, a highly powerful data analysis tool. Through friends in urban management studies, I have learned that quantitative analysis in public policy is a crucial component of both academic research and government work. I hope to gain relevant knowledge and have the opportunity to participate in a comprehensive policy analysis project.\n\n\n\n\nEmail: zheng21@upenn.edu\nGitHub: @xqdqc_hub"

These counties have high confidence data with MOE percentages below 5%, and algorithms can safely use this data for resource allocation.\nCounties requiring additional oversight: In this experiment, none were selected. My recommendations are that we should implement periodic review of algorithm outputs and consider using supplemental indicators or combining multiple data sources to reduce uncertainty.\nCounties needing alternative approaches: Sierra. I suggest avoiding relying solely on algorithmic outputs. We can collect additional survey data or use qualitative local knowledge to inform decisions."

Did you need to transform it?\n\nThe CRS of schools and bike network data is EPSG 3857, the CRS of crime data is EPSG 4326. So I have got crime data transformed.\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\nThis analysis investigates whether school zones in Philadelphia are safe environments, by examining the number of nearby crime incidents.\n\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\n\n# Your spatial analysis\nschool_buffers &lt;- st_buffer(schools, dist = 1000)\n\ncrime_join &lt;- st_join(crime, school_buffers, join = st_within, left = FALSE)\n\n\nView(crime_join)\n\n\nschool_crime_count &lt;- crime_join %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(school_nam) %&gt;%\n  summarize(crime_count = n())\n\nschools_with_crime &lt;- schools %&gt;%\n  left_join(school_crime_count, by = \"school_nam\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(crime_count = replace_na(crime_count, 0))\n\n\nhead(schools_with_crime)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -8366653 ymin: 4857549 xmax: -8346614 ymax: 4878677\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator\n        aun school_num location_i                     school_nam\n1 226518902         NA       &lt;NA&gt;

However, a few schools stand out as clear hotspots, with significantly higher counts exceeding 6,000 incidents, concentrated primarily in central and southern parts of the city. The histogram confirms this right-skewed distribution, where a small proportion of schools account for a disproportionately large share of nearby crimes. These findings suggest that while most school zones remain relatively safe, targeted safety interventions and “Safe Routes to School” programs should prioritize the high-crime areas identified in the analysis."
