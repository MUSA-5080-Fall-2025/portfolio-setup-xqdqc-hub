I am currently a MUSA student. My email address is zheng21@upenn.edu, and my GitHub username is xqdqc_hub. I am taking this course to learn R, a highly powerful data analysis tool. Through friends in urban management studies, I have learned that quantitative analysis in public policy is a crucial component of both academic research and government work. I hope to gain relevant knowledge and have the opportunity to participate in a comprehensive policy analysis project.\n\n\n\n\nEmail: zheng21@upenn.edu\nGitHub: @xqdqc_hub"

These counties have high confidence data with MOE percentages below 5%, and algorithms can safely use this data for resource allocation.\nCounties requiring additional oversight: In this experiment, none were selected. My recommendations are that we should implement periodic review of algorithm outputs and consider using supplemental indicators or combining multiple data sources to reduce uncertainty.\nCounties needing alternative approaches: Sierra. I suggest avoiding relying solely on algorithmic outputs. We can collect additional survey data or use qualitative local knowledge to inform decisions."
